## Project Description

This is an app/idea that lets you make your car really yours. It uses AR(Augmented Reality) that enables you to interact with your car in a different way. 
Seeing the rapid growth of AR technology, you will need another way to interact with the world. Currently this app shows you the stats and overlays information of your car, but the idea is, in the near future where everyone has AR capable "glasses", like Hololens, you'll just need to look at your car and you'll see all the information you need displayed in the real world, with which you'll be able to interact.
Also, this opens the possibility of a community. Imagine you and your friend have the same car, they look the same, so yours doesn't stand out. With our app you'll be able to customize your car, change colour, add 3d models, text, etc.. And others will just need point their phone at your car to see your awesome customizations.

Note: Currently the app is only a mockup version, not a complete working demo.

## How to build and run the project.

To build you'll need to import the project(folder named "mycAR") into Unity 3D and build it to desired platform or you could just get this prebuilt apk.

You can test the app on these two trackers:

## Improvements and other ideas

By entering the Challenge very late, we didn't have enough time to implement the proper use of the Smart API. Also if we had a designer in the team, we could have implemented a better presentation demo.
If the Smart API had the option of listing the exact location of all the cars in a radius of 20 meters, we could have used the geolocation based AR and with openCV could have overlayed a 3d model of the car on the original, allowing even more possibilities.

It would be great if the API had a rudimentary smart driving access.
